# Adrian Zaia . Jarvis Consulting
I am a Computer Science Graduate from Ryerson University. I first started learning about programming in High School with Java and HTML, i gained an interest in seeing programs come to life through my own thinking and implementation, it felt like learning a new langauge to speak. I pursued with this passion for programming and attended Ryerson University for my degree and landed a co-op job in the summer with RBC as an Operational Risk Analyst.
