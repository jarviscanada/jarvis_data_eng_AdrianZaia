# Adrian Zaia . Jarvis Consulting

my name is Adrian Zaia and I graduated with Honours in Computer Science at Ryerson University. I first started learning programming in High School with Java and HTML, I gained an interest in seeing these programs come to life through my own thinking and implementation, it felt like learning a new language to speak. I attended Ryerson University for my degree and was able to land a co-op job in the summer with RBC as an Operational Risk Analyst.
